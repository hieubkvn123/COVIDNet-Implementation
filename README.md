# COVIDNet-Implementation
A replication of COVIDNet for COVID-19 diagnosis.
The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09871)

# TODO
- [ ] Create the dataloader for COVIDx dataset.
- [ ] Replicate the original COVID-Net model.
- [ ] Create a training script and push the result on Wandb.ai.
- [ ] Implement changes and further improvements to COVID-Net.
